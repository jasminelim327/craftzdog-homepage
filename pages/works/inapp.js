There is a need for a solution that simplifies this process while providing valuable insights through comprehensive metrics.<br></br>

      The SDK that my team has developed addresses this need by offering pre-built components that can be seamlessly integrated into any web application. It collects metrics to evaluate the performance and user experience, categorized into Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction.
